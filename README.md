This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input their age, gender, height, and weight, and calculates their BMI accordingly.

## Features:

### Manual Calculation:
- Users can input their age, gender, height, and weight.
- Upon clicking the "Calculate BMI" button, the BMI is computed based on the provided inputs.
- The result is displayed along with an interpretation of the BMI category.

### Facial Recognition:
- Clicking the "Start" button initiates the facial recognition feature.
- Users grant permission to access their webcam.
- A deep learning model is used to capture the user's face and predict their BMI based on facial features.
- The predicted BMI is displayed along with an interpretation of the BMI category.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML:** Provides the structure and layout of the website.
- **CSS:** Styles the website for an appealing user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the BMI calculation logic and handles user interactions.
- **Deep Learning:** Utilizes a pre-trained model for facial recognition to predict BMI based on facial features.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `calculator.html` file in your web browser.
3. Input your age, select your gender, and enter your height and weight.
4. Click on the "Calculate BMI" button to see the result.
5. To begin, click on the "Start" button to activate the facial recognition feature.
6. Grant permission to access your webcam when prompted.
